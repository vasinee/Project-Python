Hanjie is fun puzzle, where correctly solving the puzzle will reveal a hidden picture.

----- How to play HANJIE -----

 Open game's windows. 
--> Select which stage you want to play.
--> A row or column with a single number clue such as "4" means that there are 4 consecutive shaded squares 
    and that the rest of the row/column is empty. 
--> If there are multiple numbers, such as "2 3 1", then this tells you about multiple sets of consecutive 
    shaded squares. "2 3 1" means for example that there are 2 consecutive shaded squares, a gap of one or 
    more empty squares, 3 consecutive shaded squares, a gap of one or more empty squares, and then 1 shaded square.
    In other words, the order of the numbers tells you the order that the different groups of consecutive shaded 
    squares are found in.
